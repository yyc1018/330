I am unfamiliar with GitHub and do not know how to upload a folder containing folders. Because I do not have a premium account on 
WeTransfer, the above link expires in a week (10 Jun 2021).

If you require access to the results after this expiration date, please do not hesitate contact me at yyc1018@ic.ac.uk or my supervisor.
