The zip file containing all three experimental data sets provided by my supervisor, Dr Ruben Perez-Carrasco can be accessed via the link below.

Unfortunately, the large sizes of the original data files and zip file means I am unable to upload them directly here. Because I do not have a premium account on 
WeTransfer, the above link expires in a week (10 Jun 2021).

If you require access to the data after this expiration date, please do not hesitate contact me at yyc1018@ic.ac.uk or my supervisor.
